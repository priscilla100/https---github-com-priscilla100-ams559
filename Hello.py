        Attacks/errors on GOOSE datasets:
        - MS: the stNum value is higher or slightly higher than the previously recorded stNum, 
        and sqNum is not 0.
        - MS: Replaying a previously valid GOOSE frame that contains a high stNum and sqNum is 0, but has a stale timestamp.
        - MS: When a frame has a high stNum and sqNum is 0, and there is a valid timestamp.
        - MS: When a frame has a high sqNum causes GOOSE frames to arrive at the receiver out of sequence.
        - DoS: Up to 10 packets are sent within 10 ms.
        - NE: There should be a packet (dataset) within 10s.
